             <h3>You can support Guruji through a monthly recurring fees through <a href="https://www.Patreon.com/yoginishchal">his profile on Patreon</a> too.</h3>
            <br>
      
            Patreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid. 
            However, since this page is for our own personal network of people, who earn in Rupees, so we have attached on the cover page our Indian payment gateway to receive your support for Preseed, in the form of one time Fee for its founder's submission to the self assumed job of imparting knowledge, for free to you, at our time cost. 
            We are now becoming a serious business as our startups are off the ground. For this deep dive into living life consciously, enable us so we can create an extraordinary assisting infrastructure around Guruji. 
            This infrastructure is a startup fund for our own startups. Ths is the last resource we need to give wings to Guruji's ideas and works. With it a 10 year journey of Preseed will come to its decade long goal. This fund will be built out of your support as fees for our perseverance of 10 years towards sharing both, innovation and knowledge. We need to book Rs. 100 crores from the fees you will pay us. All of this money will be used to create that startup fund called - A Guruji's Fund. Thereafter, see the level of far fetched innovation Guruji will unleash on this unjust world of gullible global citizens, so they be gullible no more.

                          <br></br>
                          Over the last 10 years in Delhi I have come to realise that the culture of entrepreneurship,
                          even though is on the rise, still doesn’t educate on the essence of simplicity, bootstrapping
                          and quick launch.
                          <br></br>
                          Anyway, that being the broader life skill we wan’t be able to conclusively impart by running a
                          programme -:
                          <br></br>
                          <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51" target="_blank">
                            <h4>‘Marketing Precedes Coding’</h4>
                          </a>
                          <br>
                          (Do read the article linked with this heading). Some of the points of training students in
                          this specific field is that -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. Hackers can be found because hackers have enough tools on the web to learn hacking from
                          like on mentioned on this kippt list and enough platforms to shoot their queries to, to feed
                          on their curiosity. Moreover there are many programmes to train people in programing.<br>
                          2. Designers are those who are artists in their soul anyway. They will figure their route to
                          becoming designers anyway. They too have too many schools, programmes and online tools to
                          begin with.<br>
                          3. Hustler — This guy is the guy who is enterprising enough to go out there on the ground and
                          connect the dots. One of his main jobs is to be able to <b>market the idea</b> that he is
                          going out there to create. <b>We want to train this guy over how marketing is done in this new
                            age way even prior to the product is built.</b><br>
                          4. Above all, this is the chance for graduates to get in tune with the world their colleges
                          never taught them about. The world of building startups.<br></br>
                          So clearly this programme is for those who are specifically interested in learning digital
                          marketing for the purpose of product launches. For these guys truly understand the importance
                          of being able to launch their future idea even if there was little to no money to doing so.
                          <br></br>
                          We will essentially teach you about distribution of web and mobile apps through educating you
                          over -:
                          <br></br>
                          1. How were some of the most extraordinary companies built?<br>
                          2. What does the contemporary startup ecosystem of the world look like after the creation of
                          products like Angellist?<br>
                          3. What is a good idea?<br>
                          4. The tools that empower us in building a company.<br>
                          5. Above all, the new age ways of marketing because the web has become extremely social, thus,
                          changing the landscape of past ways of marketing still being taught in a lot of MBA
                          Schools.<br>
                          6. Above all we will teach you how to use the internet to learn.<br></br>
                          <b>We will train you over a period of 1 year and give you no f**king degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship.</b> We will put you through real job scenarios to give you good insights
                          into what it takes to really build something from technology to design.
                          <br></br>
                          Above all we would impart in you the culture Preseed is being built upon. In doing so every
                          member of the Preseed team will come forward to teaching you a thing or two. <b>Hence, every
                            one from the <a href="http://preseed.in/team" target="_blank">Preseed Team</a> is a mentor
                            here. These are the men you could learn from apart from our own set of educators hand picked
                            from the industry.</b>
                          <br></br>
                          Some University's will give you a UGC recognized degree in Masters in Entrepreneurship for your efforts in Entrepreneurship. However, if
                          you are really coming to us so that you could startup your own business really really soon,
                          you will never have to need your degree certificate.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you understand we are training you not only for your job as a marketer at a good tech
                          startup, but to help you build one yourself someday.
                          <br></br>
                          I hope you also realise that if you are neither a designer nor a hacker and you still want to
                          be able to be a co founder in a tech startup right from it’s day 1, you need to be the guy who
                          can prelaunch it for customer validation the moment your product’s 1st version is ready. This
                          is the gap you will fill in the team of 2 people, one hacker and one designer, building a
                          product.
                          <br></br>
                          However if you are designer or a hacker, and yet wish to learn to distribute tech products on
                          the web, please join in. You will learn a lot beyond your current skills.

                        internet — Mostly the blogs and past works of such people give us an insight into their spirit

                          can be incubated/invested upon by top incubators and accelerators in the world like <a

                          What may these incubators look for?<br><br>
                          1. Idea — We do that so thoroughly that never have we heard from the top people in the
                          community that our idea was any short of being pretty kick ass and thoughtful.<br><br>
                          2. MVP — The R & D process of Preseed Web Lab is dedicated to this.<br><br>
                          3. Team.</i>
                          
                            While the MVP of your product is being planned from our location, we take full responsibility to teach you to
                            market it prior to even the first lines of codes are written. As your MVP gets readied from our location with
                            your remote team, and also customer-validated under our supervision, we proceed to help you understand the other
                            non-product elements of that idea, the culture that will strengthen your startup.<br><br>
                            An e.g. of that hustle is — the <a href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51">prelaunch
                              marketing</a>, which we ourselves did for each of our own products before we went on to make them. <br><br>
                            We need you to be under the same roof as us to teach you what we did with our products.<br><br>
                            To sum up -:<br><br>
                            1. You need to build a team of inspired hacker, designer and hustler per idea so that you can be incubated at a
                            worthy startup incubator with your product.<br><br>
                            2. You need to ensure that before the product’s single line is coded the product already has atleast 500
                            pre-launch subscribers.<br><br>
                            3. You need to ensure that the product’s MVP is working well for the early adopters.<br><br>
                            4. You need to do all of this without burning a single penny because we believe web startups can be/should be
                            MVPed at 0 monetary costs, just the way we did it for our products. <br><br><!-- <b>The cost of infrastructure will be, however, born by Preseed Ecell till you are here with us.</b>-->

                            mobile apps, and have the love for technology enough to learn how to code, design and market it, all nearly
                            equally then this may be the best training ground for you. In short if we could define you as -: ‘a new age web
                            hustler’ willing to ‘drop out’ of his college to help us build ‘Preseed’ over and above anything else, till you
                            have an altruistic idea of your own.<br><br>
                            I assure you the result of the knowledge you will garner here over a period of 1 year would empower you enough
                            to build a technology startup of your own someday soon, and that too, with a very mature perspective.<br><br>

                        are talking about a co-living for extra-ordinary people</strong>. <br><br>
                      We would like to build a community of all those crazy talented individuals who when pulled
                      together can produce revolutionary technology products. We will choose those best ones from our
                      campaigns and provide them a platform through a co-living and co-working away from the city, even
                      if within a city. Such will be the environment and surroundings of such a place. <br><br>
                      Another co-founder of Preseed Prints, Paras Pundir, has this to say after understanding my vision
                      and launch strategy of it, “We strongly believe that there is a need of this unique kind of
                      community in India. Many will be there who would like to become a part of this revolution and from
                      there comes the idea of crowdfunding this campaign with the best content and networks. Mostly it
                      will be provided by Guruji. We will run this campaign over one of the best crowdfunding platform
                      called Indiegogo. We plan to make this campaign reach more than one lakh appropriate people in
                      India. <br><br>
                      About myself, having a keen interest in building communities and helping people to bring out their
                      best, I’ll be taking care of all the marketing and community building activities. In past, I have
                      built few most engaging communities from the scratch say a community of Product Managers, Quality
                      Analysts, UX designers, Community Managers, footballers and a little more. I have been helping
                      other startups and community persons in keeping their big communities alive. I would be very much
                      interested in this community of extra-ordinaries”.

                      <h4>Noshow Gurukul Spaces</h4>

                      In today’s age of simple and well designed web tools for collaboration, if one starts using them
                      well, no one would really require to book office spaces when they are a team of 2–3 working out of
                      their homes. However, each in the team needs to be intrinsically motivated to do so. Remote
                      working is the future of boundless collaborations. <br><br>
                      Am I saying that people don’t need offices? I am saying that people don’t need offices
                      prematurely. They need offices when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, they should just bootstrap
                      their style of work. <br><br>
                      When it becomes absolutely necessary they should come and spend sometime at a place like Noshow Gururkul Spaces. <br><br>
                      <i>We are helping build this space further with a simple thought in our minds, that if about over
                        50
                        crazy ones who are building things with us are placed under one roof every single day, an
                        incredible amount of learning can take place. <br><br>
                        We really do feel that working in isolation of the vibe of the progressive conversations takes
                        away the possibility of incredibly valuable advise and perspectives.</i> <br><br>
                        Noshow Gururkul spaces are a proposed cafe, co-working and co-living where you could come and co
                      create with others like you and us. This space is that environment we have always envisioned as a
                      required creative space for a budding entrepreneur. A place where you could come and spend your
                      time collaboratively and creatively at. <br><br>
                      Through such space we aim to create an open environment for co creation and innovation. Over a
                      period of time we hope to be the place you brainstormed all stages of your startup at. <br><br>
                      In Noshow Gururkul spaces, you start, unlike your college where you do everything but start. We
                      clearly believe that entrepreneurship is not something that can be taught in a classroom full of
                      structured courses common for all. Entrepreneurship is a drive that occurs through self motivation
                      arising out of your own story. It can’t be taught by professors at colleges. Here we just hope to
                      create a ‘go to place’ for you where you could start.
                      <br><br>
                      Features (this is how we envision the space by June 2018 with the following key elements) –
                      <ol>
                        <li> The entrepreneurs — That will be the key contributors to the vibe of that place.</li>
                        <li> The music — Sets the tone of the place. (We will continue to have soulful progressive
                          musical events at our venue)</li>
                        <li> The White Boards and conference rooms — Brainstorming.</li>
                        <li> Internet/wifi — Necessity.</li>
                        <li> The Entrepreneurship Events and startup meetups — Engagement.</li>
                        <li> Advisory — Questions and guidance.</li>
                        <li> Networking with Investors, mentors and most cost effective vendors for your requirement.
                        </li>
                        <li> Fellow Entrepreneurs — The examples and the experience.</li>
                        <li> Access to the Indian startup ecosystem.</li>
                        <li>. Yummy meals!!</li>

                      </ol>
                      <br>
                      <strong>We only claim that at the least this space is going to end up broadening your perspective
                        on how you want to approach your journey ahead. Having said that, in our hind sight we do
                        believe that, this space will make you feel empowered to start before you thought you
                        could.</strong>
                      <br><br>
                      The difference between boot camps, Incubators or any other entrepreneurship initiative and
                      <strong> Noshow Gururkul spaces</strong> is that this space is not something that finishes like an event does.
                      Once an event
                      finishes what happens to the ‘Entrepreneur’, where does he go thereafter. Noshow Gururkul space is a
                      place that remains and you can come here as many times you want. It never finishes on you.

                      <h2>Event Protocol</h2>
                      <h3>
                        There are four basic recurring events within preseed:-
                      </h3>



                      1. Delhi Meetup: <br>
                      Record the names and agendas of the ones who are the most important during the meetup.
                      <br><br>2. Demo Day: <br>
                      The first demo day, is when the startups who are already sort of up and running will come and they
                      will get to know in one session what Preseed is all about and how Preseed can help them. After
                      this
                      on the same day there will be one on one meetings with the people who want to talk about their
                      association or plan with preseed. The startups who require straight away investing will then be
                      shortlisted for the Investor’s Demo Day after 7 days. The ones that need help to bootstrap will
                      meet
                      with Nischal and discuss their plan with Preseed from then on.
                      <br><br>3. Investors Demo Day: <br>
                      On this day, the startups that require investing will be invited to demonstrate their business
                      plan
                      to a panel of interested investors and funds. They will be shortlisted from here by the investors
                      for funding. Here are the protocols.

       <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Preseed Web Lab is the name we have given to Guruji's mind. His mind has something of great interest to us - His vision for citizens of the world. In that he has decided to execute more than talk. So, look to stumble upon Guruji's startups to see that vision manifesting through his preseed stage startups, for a journey until 2029. Basically, his mind has a natural backdrop made of long term solutions to complexed problems to be solved through a mesh of his startups, for Indian citizens first.

        covered some

        dedicate our
        whole lives to the cause of his meaningful technology entrepreneurship, regardless. We hope we are able to be of
        some impact
        there. Infact, <a

        inspired ones can build with us web products, upon ideas that aid me in the above mentioned goals. Some of
        those goals
        may truly have the potential to change the world. This is the pitch that formed the goal of conducting these

            <div>
              <i>Q) Are you looking only for people to work on your specific ideas, Guruji? If not, how do you pick one over the others? We came here through a general google search for Preseed funding for our startup. We found your webpage called The Simple fund through this link simple.preseed.in on the first page of that Google search result. Is your company Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd also an incubator or an investor of some kind?
<br><br>
A) Preseed is a virtual incubator* primarily focused on incubating Guruji’s own product ideas first as listed below, which in turn are directly aligned with our mission of greater freedom.
<br><br>
Preseed takes inspiration in the way Guruji thinks business ideas. Hence, it stays focused on finding resources to 
empower him on his products first. The vision for the fund above is also really to find an investor who can create this fund which
 in turn enables us to continue finding more entrepreneurs like Guruji who really want to do something genuinely meaningful.
 <br><br>
We have designed this website to look for people mostly to work on Guruji’s own consumer web ideas represented in <b>PRESEED WEB LAB</b>. 

That is why Guruji built Preseed in the first place. 
		      <br><br>
		      However, if there is ‘someone with an idea’ and or capability that
 catches his fancy, we would be willing to put in all we can into that idea too. His experiences puts him in a fairly good position to make judgments about what/who to pursue and what/who to say no to.
 *An incubator that supports you like any other incubator but without a fixed physical space, or monetary investment.
 For us to support people who are self-inspired, just an internet connection at their homes is sufficient.
 <br><br>
 

<b>Future:</b> The simple fund is merely a concept for now. We are however curating deals to build a fund around. So far the 
success we have achieved can be measured by how many startups have found TSF web page organically by searching a relevant keyword called 
‘Preseed funding’. We have engaged with over 20% of such startups, meaning 20+ relevant startups ready to raise money. We are nearly ready
 to float a fund around our startup deal flow. If you are an investor, please get in touch with nishchal@preseed.in.</i>

                                Todoed is made up of I(could be the ceo) and Dhaval(could be the cto) full time. And
                                there are two
                                part time advisors (passive tech advisor&hairsp;-&hairsp;Saikiran and fairly active tech advisor/hands
                                on
                                coder/backend Ansal). <br>
                                This is the Todoed core team&hairsp;-&hairsp;I and Dhaval. This is all I need. This, all the way to
                                cover,
                                chrome extension(all to do with text&hairsp;-&hairsp;75% done) and iOS (all to do with voice and
                                text). This is
                                the iOS/backend/marketing/design team. <br>
                                It is Todoed on iOS that ultimately will solve my own problem fully that I envisioned it
                                to do for
                                me first. Todoed as a chrome extension has been able to do it only partly. <br>
                                I started my journey to inspire ideas, faith (in each other), and action among all I
                                come in
                                contact with. So, I started Preseed. Found Dhaval on that journey and mandated him to
                                build upon
                                my vision for the product, that productifies Preseed, to enable more potential
                                entrepreneurs to
                                build. The prototype is here <a href="http://myidealist.co">www.myidealist.co</a> . Now
                                while
                                journeying over this I realised a problem with my own fellows and community at Preseed,
                                where
                                actionable tasks sent over chat, kept getting lost. I told Dhaval to transfer the task
                                of building
                                MyIdealist to our other coworkers at Preseed and join me asap at building Todoed. <br>
                                In brief the above paragraph should give you a glimse over my exact motivation: <br><br>
                                1. To make people more productive. <br>
                                2. For the purpose of building ideas. <br> <br>
                                Todoed should help people be more productive for the purpose of building ideas. Some day

                                with '#idea' in Todoed will create more possibilities for users of Todoed to transition
                                that idea
                                into a MVP and then perhaps a startup. That day Todoed and MyIdealist will be very
                                closely
                                integrated. But this year, that can even be a part of dialogue. Because this year is
                                about
                                everything in Todoed except this '#idea'.

                                This is Todoed being built for the present or what I call 'the Todoed operational
                                parallel': <br>
                                <br>
                                We get tremendous invaluable support from Preseed, the noise free community of self
                                inspired
                                potential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, I started 3 years ago. That support will
                                continue
                                forever. That support means the ball at Todoed is always rolling. The hustle is always
                                on.
                                Independent of money, office, materials. It's a bonus. Large bonus. That is capable of
                                producing
                                the product, even if Dhaval and I were not there. (But Dhaval is there, has been and
                                will be,
                                forever, so had/have/will I. I have shared a profound and deeply action oriented
                                relationship with
                                Dhaval for 2 years now). <br>
                                Preseed is now represented through Govind, coordinator at Preseed; to Raj, who handles
                                Todoed at
                                Preseed, and hence is the coordinator at Todoed, meaning Raj's mandate is to extract the
                                juices
                                out of the Preseed team/network for the purpose of building Todoed, independent of the
                                works of
                                the core team of Todoed. <br>
                                Operational parallel: Raj; under my day to day directions and suggestions in freelance
                                arrangement
                                with Ansal, and advisory from Kartik Mandavidalle; with an open access to human
                                resources of
                                Preseed. This is how we have so far, Built the chrome extension; measuring it, learning
                                it,
                                repeating it. All the way to making it the best productivity chrome extension in the
                                world. This
                                is truly exactly the process that built Todoed thus far. And that is the exact process
                                that will
                                continue to build it further over the next 3 months. <br>
                                We think our chrome extension will be perfect by that time. While this is going on, Raj
                                will
                                continue to market the product and study the user metric and behavior. And then further
                                market it
                                upon those lessons. This is all about the Chrome extension. <br>
                                So there is also Raj in the Todoed team. He was my second in command at Preseed. Now he
                                is my
                                second in command in Todoed. <br>
                                Three of us are building Todoed at 0 costs to Todoed, from our own homes, I in Lucknow,
                                Raj in
                                Kolkatta, Dhaval in Ranchi. Whatever little server/freelancer costs, Preseed/Preseed
                                network takes
                                care of it. That is how we have done things and can do for a long period of time. We
                                are,in one
                                regard, self sustained. <br>
                                However, if we raise money, I can raise the bar -: <br> <br>
                                <br> 1. I want to set up a beautiful conducive office/infrastructure in Lucknow to come
                                under one
                                roof to build and grow a great roof to work from, physically also together, not just
                                mentally.
                                <br> 2. Build the product to my satisfaction in 3 months, and take I and Dhaval to
                                Silicon Valley
                                (leaving Raj and others to hustle in India), to work closely with a marketer/growth
                                hacker who has
                                been there done that. We want to go to him with a product, which is ready to be marketed
                                at his
                                full ability. I have the vision for the product, which can attract among the best
                                marketers and
                                growthhackers in the world, if we can compensate them suitablly. (This is a 100%
                                consumer web 100%
                                tech product and there is no reason for me to not build it from the place and in the
                                neighbourhood
                                of people who have done it the best).

                          We envision TSF having an office in Silicon Valley, where we will accelerate startups. We
                          are very well positioned in India to get brilliant, handpicked Indian early stage startups
                          to get baked there. The founders from our handpicked startups will eventually go to Silicon
                          Valley for this Accelerator Program. In the meantime they will be in India and be
                          accelerated from Silicon Valley by our community of advisors and our manager sitting there,
                          amongst the most progressive startup community. For the office space, if we can have that,
                          we are already building a network there, to send the founders of the startups, who will be
                          ready to be accelerated. If initially we can't have that space, they can be accelerated from
                          Silicon Valley(by our manager & board of advisors sitting there) while they are in India.
                          Look at our portfolio opportunities, and if you feel there can be future values made out of
                          this & even if one is successful, and you think its worth your time, then please come on
                          board. Sharing substantial portions of this business with you or anyone you recommend will
                          be our pleasure - we can come on papers almost immediately to have this deal.
